## Overview
Mewazar is built for a Pakistani food business: customers browse by category, pick pack sizes (250g / 500g / 1kg),
pay by Cash on Delivery, bank transfer or wallet, and track their parcel. The owner manages products, stock, orders,
coupons, reviews, couriers, categories, page text and even the shop name and logo from a built-in admin panel.

The storefront is fast (server components with a one-minute cache), SEO-ready, responsive from phones to desktops
and has a light and a dark theme.

## Features

- Cart drawer with free-delivery progress, wishlist, live search suggestions, filters and sorting
- Checkout with Cash on Delivery, bank transfer and wallets, coupons and reward coins
- Public order tracking (order number + phone) and "My orders" with courier tracking links
